The Bell-LaPadula model is a well-known access control model for computer security, named after its creators, David Bell and Len LaPadula. It is designed to ensure the confidentiality of classified information in a multi-level security environment. The model defines a set of rules for controlling access to sensitive data and resources and is based on the concept of a security clearance level, which determines an individual's access rights to resources. The model assumes a hierarchical structure of security clearances, with each level representing a different degree of sensitivity.
