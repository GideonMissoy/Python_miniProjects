For this task you should implement a version of the Feistel structure in Python3.
Your implementation should work on 8 bit inputs and use bitwise AND as its round function. Your
program should be called feistel.py and take the following input parameters:
(i) The first parameter is an optional option -d (for decryption).
(ii) The second parameter is an 8 bit input string.
(iii) The third parameter is the number of rounds.
(iv) The next parameters are the different round keys.
The program should return only the 8 bit result.
